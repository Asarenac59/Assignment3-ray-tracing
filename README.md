# Assignment3-ray-tracing
The purpose of this school assignment is to complete a 3D graphics program that displays parametric objects as polygonal surfaces. The tessel class creates the objects of the graphical scene into convex polygons and computes the color shades to fill the polygons with. The program requires NumPy for matrix operations and Pillow to draw and fill the result image.

## How to run the program
Simply run testAssignment3.py. The output image should be identical to the image below.
